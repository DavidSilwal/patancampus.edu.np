Recently, Tribhuvan University has launched its four years bachelor’s degree program in computer science and information technology.

The BCSIT (Bachelor in Computer Science and Information Technology) curriculum is designed by closely following the course practiced in accredited international universities and institutions, subject to the condition that the intake students are mostly from twelve year of schooling in the science stream or equivalent from any university recognized by Tribhuvan University (TU). In addition to the core computer science course and elective courses, the program offers service courses to meet the need of high technology applications. The foundation and allied courses are designed to meet the need of undergraduate academic program requirements, and the service courses are designed to meet the need of market demand and fast changing computer technology and application. Students enrolled in the four year BCSIT program are required to take course in design and implementations of computer software systems, information technology and foundation of the theoretical model of computer science and functional background of computer hardware. All undergraduate students are required to complete 126 credit hours of computer science and allied courses.
